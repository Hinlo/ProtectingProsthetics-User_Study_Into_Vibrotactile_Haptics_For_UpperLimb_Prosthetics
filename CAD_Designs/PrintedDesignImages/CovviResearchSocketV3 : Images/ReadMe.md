# Design Notes
**Pros**
- Good fit, lighter, more ergonomic than V2. More sturdy socket to hold the hand.
- Capable of single emg activation with one arm only for pick and place, though not yet very ergonomic and high strain on the arm and shoulder

**Required Improvements**
- Battery: need space to mount battery and battery control board. These have short cables so must include a hole for these to run through. 
- Wrist Support: should be curved to the right and off centre - in line with the right curved edge near the handle. Holding your right arm out straight and making
a fist, you can see how the arm aligns with the right edge of the hand, while the thumb sticks out. 
- Thumb: since it sticks out, you should carve out a little more space for it. 
- Covvi socket mount: make slightly wider to allow for the insertion of a soft layer e.g felt, to protect the mount on the universal socket. 

**Potential Redesign**
Design to grip from above the hand
- wrist locking mechanism the same but with curved forearm support above it
- slits in the wrist support to allow for velcro straps
- Design hole and space for battery below
- consider whether to add solid handle section or allow free movement at the wrist to enable dual emg activation.
If no handle, straps will need to be very snug to prevent wiggle
- need to move the cable management.
