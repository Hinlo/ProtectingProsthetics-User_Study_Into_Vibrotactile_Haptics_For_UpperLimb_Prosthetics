# Design Notes
**Pros**
- Good fit, lighter, more ergonomic than V2. More sturdy socket to hold the hand.

**Required Improvements**
- Battery: need space to mount battery and battery control board. These have short cables so must include a hole for these to run through. 
- Wrist Support: should be curved to the right and off centre - in line with the right curved edge near the handle. Holding your right arm out straight and making
a fist, you can see how the arm aligns with the right edge of the hand, while the thumb sticks out. 
- Thumb: since it sticks out, you should carve out a little more space for it.
