# Design Notes
**Pros**
- Good fit, lighter, more ergonomic than V3.
- Capable of same-arm dual EMG activation, lower strain on the arm than previous version.
- Bespoke housing for battery and control panel.

**Future Improvements**
- Could re-print with variable stiffness so that the platform can wrap more tightly to user arm.
- could reconsider how to have the prosthetic position off the end of the natural arm for more dexterous operation.
