# Covvi Research Socket V2

**Pros**
- Wrist diameter perfect
- Handle strong and well sized


**Required Improvements**
- Strong support under the wrist to counter torque of the Covvi Hand about the handle
- Thinner shell - 3mm down from 5mm
- open top plan
- Flexible, strapable supports on the side of the handle which could be fitted snugly to the arm with velcro. These will be made of Agilus 30
- Wrist opening should be longer and thicker (stronger overall)
- Underneath cable channel can be much smaller, 20mm height too large. 
- Wing and wrist support attachments will be screwed on - m5 size thread holes (about 6.2mm diameter) should be designed into v3.
