# MSc_Robotics_Dissertation
This repo contains my MSc Robotics Dissertation project, carried out in Summer 2023 at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory.

The project investigates the viability of vibrotactile urgent alerts for protecting actuated upper-limb prosthetics. Specifically invesigating the effects of cognitive and physical load on user reaction time and perceived vibration intensity.
